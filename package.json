  "readme": "# core-lang\nClasses that should be in the JavaScript language itself. The collections have full promises support, and TypeScript definitions.\n## Usage\n<img src=\"doc/class-diagram.png\">\n## Collections\nAll collections inherit from XIterable. It returns an iterator and offers the classic Array methods of iteration,\nalso filter, map/reduce, etc. with the same signature.\nIn addition some methods are added (some of them inspired from groovy) to make chaining more easier (such as `groupBy`,\n`transform`, `first` or `butFirst`).\nLast but not least the collections have full `Promise`s support, and allow processing of their content using the `Promise`\nAPI. For example, assuming that our collection contains promises, we can:\n```javascript\nlist([1,2,3,4])\n    .map(Promise.resolve, Promise) // make them promises\n    .mapPromise(function(it) {\n        // mapPromise first resolves the items in the collection,\n        // then it applies the mapping function\n        // all the items are resolved at his stage, so we have the initial\n        // array, being iterated over. We create new promises.\n        return Promise.resolve(it * it);\n    }).then(function(collection) {\n        // not only the value before mapping gets resolved, but also\n        // the result gets first Promise.resolved and only after\n        // added back into the collection\n        assert.equal([1,4,9,16], collection.asArray());\n    });\n```\nFurthermore since the collections are written in TypeScript, the module embeds the .d.ts file, so you get full\nautocomplete and documentation support from the IDE (pictured Visual Studio Code)\n<img src=\"doc/vscode-autocomplete.png\"/>\n## ChangeLog\n* v.1.0.0  2015-08-31  Initial release.\n",
